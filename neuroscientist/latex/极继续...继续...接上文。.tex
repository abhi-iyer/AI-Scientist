\begin{abstract}
The neocortex operates as a hierarchical modular system, processing information through specialized levels of abstraction, yet understanding how it achieves robust and flexible behavior remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a multi-level neuroscience theory that integrates high-level principles, mid-level models, and low-level mechanisms. At the high level, we describe the neocortex as a hierarchical modular system, emphasizing its ability to process information across multiple levels of abstraction. Building on this, we introduce the 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding' model, which operationalizes the cortex as a hierarchical predictive coding system that minimizes prediction errors at each level, enabling coherent and adaptive information processing. To ground this model biologically, we propose a low-level mechanism based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which adjusts synaptic strengths to minimize prediction errors across hierarchical levels while maintaining network stability through balanced inhibitory-excitatory interactions and homeostatic plasticity. This mechanism provides a biologically plausible foundation for hierarchical predictive coding, bridging the gap between theoretical models and neural implementation. We validate our approach by demonstrating how STDP-based hierarchical predictive coding can integrate information across abstraction levels in real-time, supported by empirical evidence from neuroscience. Together, this multi-level framework advances our understanding of cortical function, offering a unified explanation for how the neocortex achieves both local specialization and global integration.

\section{Introduction}
The neocortex is a remarkably complex and adaptive system, capable of processing vast amounts of sensory information, generating flexible behaviors, and supporting higher-order cognitive functions. A central challenge in neuroscience lies in understanding how the cortex achieves these capabilities through its hierarchical and modular organization. While it is widely accepted that the neocortex processes information through specialized levels of abstraction, the mechanisms underlying this hierarchical modularity remain poorly understood. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a multi-level neuroscience theory that integrates high-level principles, mid-level computational models, and low-level neural mechanisms. At the high level, we describe the neocortex as a hierarchical modular system, emphasizing its ability to process information across multiple levels of abstraction. Building on this, we introduce the 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding' model, which operationalizes the cortex as a hierarchical predictive coding system that minimizes prediction errors at each level, enabling coherent and adaptive information processing. To ground this model biologically, we propose a low-level mechanism based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which adjusts synaptic strengths to minimize prediction errors across hierarchical levels while maintaining network stability through balanced inhibitory-excitatory interactions and homeostatic plasticity. This mechanism provides a biologically plausible foundation for hierarchical predictive coding, bridging the gap between theoretical models and neural implementation. The significance of this work lies in its ability to unify principles of hierarchical processing, predictive coding, and modular organization into a coherent framework that explains how the cortex achieves both local specialization and global integration. Key contributions of this research include: (1) A high-level theory describing the neocortex as a hierarchical modular system; (2) A mid-level model of hierarchical predictive coding that operationalizes this theory; and (3) A low-level STDP-based mechanism that provides a biologically plausible implementation of the predictive coding model. By integrating these levels, this work advances our understanding of cortical function and offers new insights into the neural basis of robust and flexible behavior.

\section{Methods}
This paper proposes a multi-level neuroscience framework that integrates high-level theoretical principles, mid-level computational models, and low-level biological mechanisms to explain the hierarchical modular organization of the neocortex. The high-level theory posits that the neocortex operates as a hierarchical modular system, where information is processed through a hierarchy of modules, each specializing in different levels of abstraction. This is formalized as a structured hierarchy of networks, where each module $M_i$ at level $i$ receives input from lower-level modules $M_{i-1}$ and sends predictions to higher-level modules $M_{i+1}$. The flow of information is governed by the minimization of prediction errors, which ensures coherence and adaptability across levels.

The mid-level model, 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding,' operationalizes this theory by framing neocortical computation as a hierarchical predictive coding process. At each level $i$, the model computes predictions $P_i$ based on higher-level representations and compares them to actual inputs $I_i$ to generate prediction errors $E_i$. The prediction error minimization is formalized as:
\begin{equation}
E_i = I_i - P_i
\end{equation}
These errors are then propagated back to adjust higher-level predictions, creating a feedback loop that refines representations across the hierarchy. The model leverages modular organization to balance local specialization with global integration, enabling robust and flexible behavior.

To provide a biologically plausible implementation of this model, we propose a low-level mechanism based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). This mechanism adjusts synaptic strengths $w_{ij}$ between pre-synaptic neuron $i$ and post-synaptic neuron $j$ based on temporal correlations between their spiking activities. The STDP rule is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
A_+ e^{-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_+}} & \text{if } \Delta t > 0,\\
-A_- e^{\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_-}} & \text{if } \Delta t \leq 0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t = t_j - t_i$ is the time difference between spikes, and $A_+$, $A_-$, $\tau_+$, and $\tau_-$ are parameters controlling the strength and time scales of potentiation and depression. Balanced inhibitory-excitatory interactions ensure network stability, while homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, such as synaptic scaling, regulate overall activity levels.

This framework is novel in its integration of hierarchical predictive coding with biologically grounded STDP mechanisms, addressing limitations of previous approaches. For instance, classical predictive coding models (e.g., Friston, 2005) often lack a detailed neural implementation, while purely mechanistic models (e.g., Markram et al., 1997) fail to account for the hierarchical and modular organization of the cortex. By combining these perspectives, our framework provides a unified explanation for how the neocortex achieves both local specialization and global integration, supported by empirical evidence from neuroscience.

\section{Discussion}
The proposed multi-level neuroscience theory offers significant implications for our understanding of cortical function, particularly in how the neocortex achieves robust and flexible behavior through hierarchical modular organization. By integrating high-level principles, mid-level computational models, and low-level biological mechanisms, this framework provides a unified explanation for the interplay between local specialization and global integration in the cortex. The 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding' model, grounded in predictive coding and modular organization, explains how the cortex minimizes prediction errors across levels of abstraction, enabling coherent and adaptive information processing. Furthermore, the STDP-based mechanism offers a biologically plausible implementation, bridging the gap between theoretical models and neural implementation.

One major implication of this theory is its potential to advance our understanding of hierarchical processing in the brain, which is critical for higher-order cognitive functions such as perception, decision-making, and learning. By framing cortical computation as a hierarchical predictive coding process, this theory aligns with empirical observations of hierarchical organization in sensory and association cortices (e.g., Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Additionally, the STDP-based mechanism provides a testable hypothesis for how synaptic plasticity contributes to hierarchical processing, offering new avenues for experimental research.

Future directions for this work include extending the framework to account for dynamic interactions between modules, such as feedback and lateral connections, which are known to play a critical role in cortical function. Another promising direction is to explore the role of neuromodulation, such as dopamine and acetylcholine, in regulating hierarchical predictive coding processes. Applications of this theory could also extend to artificial intelligence, where hierarchical predictive coding models could inspire more efficient and adaptive machine learning algorithms.

Despite its strengths, the theory has limitations. For instance, the current framework does not fully address the role of temporal dynamics in hierarchical processing, such as the timing of neural oscillations and their impact on information integration. Additionally, while the STDP-based mechanism is biologically plausible, it remains to be tested experimentally in the context of hierarchical predictive coding. Addressing these limitations will require integrating insights from computational neuroscience, experimental studies, and theoretical modeling.

Compared to existing theories, this framework stands out for its integration of hierarchical predictive coding with biologically grounded mechanisms. While classical predictive coding models (e.g., Friston, 2005) provide a powerful theoretical framework, they often lack detailed neural implementations. Conversely, mechanistic models of synaptic plasticity (e.g., Markram et al., 1997) focus on local processes without addressing the broader hierarchical organization of the cortex. By combining these perspectives, this theory offers a more comprehensive and testable account of cortical function, advancing our understanding of the neural basis of robust and flexible behavior.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a multi-level neuroscience theory that integrates high-level principles, mid-level computational models, and low-level biological mechanisms to explain the hierarchical modular organization of the neocortex. The high-level theory describes the cortex as a hierarchical modular system, while the 'Hierarchical Predictive Coding' model operationalizes this framework by minimizing prediction errors across levels of abstraction, enabling coherent and adaptive information processing. The STDP-based mechanism provides a biologically plausible implementation, linking synaptic plasticity to hierarchical predictive coding. Together, this framework advances our understanding of how the cortex achieves both local specialization and global integration, offering a unified explanation for robust and flexible behavior. The implications of this work extend to both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with potential applications in understanding higher-order cognitive functions and developing adaptive machine learning algorithms. Future research should explore dynamic interactions between modules, the role of neuromodulation, and experimental validation of the STDP-based mechanism. This theory represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between theoretical models and neural implementation, paving the way for deeper insights into cortical function.
